Overview
========

These are my solutions to the Project Euler problems. They are disorganized as hell and the older ones may or may not run. In general:

* Haskell source files can be compiled with GHC 6. (Something like: `ghc -O pXXXX.hs -o pXXXX`. Some simpler problems might not have a main function, and I most likely solved those via the REPL.)
* Lisp sources are probably the remnants of me solving something using a CLISP repl (problems that involve translating numbers to english words are particularly easy in lisp, because format has support for doing that).
* C sources can all be built with the single makefile; the binaries a produced in `bin/`.
